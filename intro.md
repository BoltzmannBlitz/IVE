# 1. About the IVE

Public displays have become ubiquitous in urban areas. They can efficiently deliver information to many people and increasingly also provide means for interaction. Designing, developing, and testing such systems can be challenging, particularly if a system consists of many displays in multiple locations. Deployment is costly and contextual factors such as placement within and interaction with the environment can have a major impact on the success of such systems. In the course of our research we developed a new prototyping and evaluation method for public display systems that integrates augmented panoramic imagery and a light-weight, graph-based model to simulate such systems. Our approach facilitates low-effort, rapid design of interactive public display systems and their evaluation. We realized a prototypical implementation and carried out an initial assessment based on a comparison with existing methods, our own experiences, and an example case study.
